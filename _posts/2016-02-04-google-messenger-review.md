# Review - Google Messenger

<h3>

Google Messenger
</h3>

I have using [Google Nexus 4](https://store.google.com/product/nexus_4_16gb) for more than 2 years, have experienced Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) to 5.1 (Lollipop).
The initial message APP was [Messaging](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.concentriclivers.mms.com.android.mms&hl=en), then [Google Hangouts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk&hl=en).

Until yesterday I opened Hangouts, it promoted me a new official message APP - [Google Messenger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging&hl=en). 
Today I installed it to have a try. The first impression is it looks similar with Hangouts, with simpler interface and faster.
I'm happy to keep it and replace Hangouts, however there still some points I want to mention/complain.

Problem 1 - Phone Stored Messages
</h3>

![Blocked history message](http://atealxt.github.io/images/20160204/1_spam_msg.png "Blocked history message")

First of all I open the APP and see huge old messages (please ignore the unknown language/character, and as you may know, yes my living city have a big issue of spam message - faked base station, unscrupulous ads and suspicious sms).

So I realized all blocked number/message from Hangouts are archived not deleted actually, and there is no synchronization from Hangouts, I have to delete them again each by each.

Problem 2 - Easy to Misoperation
</h3>

![Easy to misoperation](http://atealxt.github.io/images/20160204/2_single_select.png "Easy to misoperation")

After I choose a item, from picture you can see the icons `Add to Contact` and `Block` are very close to each other, however they have totally opposite meaning. 
It is highly possible to click the wrong button, especially on small-screen phone or you have big finger.

Problem 3 - Block Confirmation
</h3>

![Block confirmation](http://atealxt.github.io/images/20160204/3_block.png "Block confirmation")

A confirmation will display if I clicked the block button. 
I don't know why Google didn't implement it as a "undo" feature directly, maybe they thought confirmation will inform user a better effect. However it doubled my operations.
(BTW it's already doing better than Hangouts, which you need to go into view that number then you can block it!)

Problem 4 - Multiple Selection
</h3>

![Multiple selection](http://atealxt.github.io/images/20160204/4_double_select.png "Multiple selection")

There is no block option for select multiple items. I have only one word - OMG!

Problem 5 - So Many History Records
</h3>

![So many history records](http://atealxt.github.io/images/20160204/5_history.png "So many history records")

From the picture I get that I started use Hangouts from 2014, there are so many history messages, and it even doesn't have a scrollbar on UI.

Problem 6 - Blocked Numbers
</h3>

![Blocked numbers](http://atealxt.github.io/images/20160204/6_blocked.png "Blocked numbers")

Just list the numbers. No search function, no import and export, no backup.
BTW I asked Hangouts team if they have [export feature](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/hangouts/R8M3wagFlic;context-place=topicsearchin/hangouts/sync$20blocked) (answer was no), unfortunately Google Messenger doesn't have this feature either.

Problem 7 - No Advanced Block Option
</h3>

![No advanced block option](http://atealxt.github.io/images/20160204/7_faked_number.png "No advanced block option")

Spams are varied - some of numbers are mobile, some are likely from service provider; some real, some faked; some long, some short.

Since my living area have terrible spam problem, I have to close whole notification of the APP.
I'm wondering if it can provide a smarter way to block number, like block by number startwith/endwith, regular expression, message content etc. (I know there must have some powerful apps on Google Play, I just didn't trust 3rd message Apps yet).

In Conclusion

I like Google Nexus, I'm enjoy Android.

The post is not means Google Messenger APP is bad, I just think it could be better.
