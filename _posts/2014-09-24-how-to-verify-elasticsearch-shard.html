Elasticsearch distribution is looks as simple as a "magician", what you need to do is just start the server then enjoy. <br>
However anyway you need to understand how it works first, then decide to pick it up or not with read each of setting property and a heavy testing.
</p>

<p>
-- Elasticsearch is a peer to peer based system, nodes communicate with one another directly if operations are delegated / broadcast. <br>
So how to verify? Two words: disable replication.

Prepare
</h3>

<p>
Download the latest stable version, unzip it and clone one to simulate a second node.
</p>

<p>
Modify `config/elasticsearch.yml` (create if not exist) <br>
<pre><code># change the default name to avoid possible conflict
cluster.name: "my_elasticsearch"

# node name
node.name: "node1" # use "node2" in second one

# disable replication
index.number_of_replicas: 0
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
Start-up servers
<pre><code>/elasticsearch-home-folder/node1/bin/elasticsearch
/elasticsearch-home-folder/node2/bin/elasticsearch
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
Check cluster status
<pre><code>http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty=true
http://localhost:9200/_cluster/state
</code></pre>
As you can see there are two nodes. Next is input data to see sharding. 
</p>

<a href="#index" name="index" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Index
</h3>

<p>
Save ten records
<pre><code>$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_bulk' -d '
  {"index":{"_index":"shakespeare","_type":"act","_id":0}}
  {"line_id":1,"play_name":"Henry IV","speech_number":"","line_number":"","speaker":"","text_entry":"ACT I"}
  {"index":{"_index":"shakespeare","_type":"scene","_id":1}}
  {"line_id":2,"play_name":"Henry IV","speech_number":"","line_number":"","speaker":"","text_entry":"SCENE I. London. The palace."}
  {"index":{"_index":"shakespeare","_type":"line","_id":2}}
  {"line_id":3,"play_name":"Henry IV","speech_number":"","line_number":"","speaker":"","text_entry":"Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others"}
  {"index":{"_index":"shakespeare","_type":"line","_id":3}}
  {"line_id":4,"play_name":"Henry IV","speech_number":1,"line_number":"1.1.1","speaker":"KING HENRY IV","text_entry":"So shaken as we are, so wan with care,"}
  {"index":{"_index":"shakespeare","_type":"line","_id":4}}
  {"line_id":5,"play_name":"Henry IV","speech_number":1,"line_number":"1.1.2","speaker":"KING HENRY IV","text_entry":"Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,"}
  {"index":{"_index":"shakespeare","_type":"line","_id":5}}
  {"line_id":6,"play_name":"Henry IV","speech_number":1,"line_number":"1.1.3","speaker":"KING HENRY IV","text_entry":"And breathe short-winded accents of new broils"}
  {"index":{"_index":"shakespeare","_type":"line","_id":6}}
  {"line_id":7,"play_name":"Henry IV","speech_number":1,"line_number":"1.1.4","speaker":"KING HENRY IV","text_entry":"To be commenced in strands afar remote."}
  {"index":{"_index":"shakespeare","_type":"line","_id":7}}
  {"line_id":8,"play_name":"Henry IV","speech_number":1,"line_number":"1.1.5","speaker":"KING HENRY IV","text_entry":"No more the thirsty entrance of this soil"}
  {"index":{"_index":"shakespeare","_type":"line","_id":8}}
  {"line_id":9,"play_name":"Henry IV","speech_number":1,"line_number":"1.1.6","speaker":"KING HENRY IV","text_entry":"Shall daub her lips with her own childrens blood;"}
  {"index":{"_index":"shakespeare","_type":"line","_id":9}}
  {"line_id":10,"play_name":"Henry IV","speech_number":1,"line_number":"1.1.7","speaker":"KING HENRY IV","text_entry":"Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,"}
'
</code></pre>
(If you are in Windows you can use Firefox + RESTClient to input data just like I did.)
</p>

<p>
See result via `http://localhost:9200/_search?q=*`, note total number of records is 10. 
</p>

<h3>
<a href="#verify" name="verify" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Verify
</h3>

<p>
Firstly let's check sharding status by look index folder
<pre><code>/elasticsearch-home-folder/node1/data/my_elasticsearch/nodes/0/indices/shakespeare/
/elasticsearch-home-folder/node1/data/my_elasticsearch/nodes/0/indices/shakespeare/
</code></pre>
A node have 2 shards (folders) and the other have 3.
</p>

<p>
Then shutdown the second node
<pre><code>$ curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/nodes/node2/_shutdown'
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
Query to see
<pre><code>http://localhost:9200/_search?q=*
</code></pre>
Oh yes only data on live sharding are returned.
</p>

<p>
check status
	http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty=true (red)
	[what is yellow]
</p>

please enable replication if want reliability
