Suppose you own a clothing enterprise and sell products online, think about the following case:
</p>
<p>
There are a large amount of T-shirt with many occasions, styles, colors etc.
You recording each of them onto the page. Through front-end search system, user can browsing/search any T-shrit they like and punch.
</p>
<p>
Sounds good, right? Unfortunately, search experience may pretty bad. 
Because of each kind of clothes is likely to have many colors and sizes, you search result is filled with "same" product.
</p>
<p>
This is I called "Document Grouping Problem". So how to solve it? Quick answer: sku data fields redundancy with aggregation search.
