Suppose you own a clothing enterprise and sell products online, think about the following case:
</p>
<p>
There are a large amount of T-shirt with many occasions, styles, colors etc.
You recording each of them onto the page. Through front-end search system, user can browsing/search any T-shrit they like and punch.
</p>
<p>
Sounds good, right? Unfortunately, search experience may pretty bad. 
Because of each kind of clothes is likely to have many colors and sizes, you search result is filled with "same" product.
</p>
<p>
This is I called "<code>Document Grouping Problem</code>". <br>
How to solve it? Quick answer: sku data fields redundancy with aggregation search.

Data Structure
</h3>

<p>
First of all, regards different color/size as different product is reasonable.
They have separate price and stock status, thay are <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_keeping_unit">SKUs</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the Search Index saving skus Cartesian Product:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>SKU#</th>
      <th>NAME</th>
      <th>KEYWORD (color, size)</th>
      <th>FAMILY_ID</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>10001</td>
      <td>Sweetly T-shirt 1</td>
      <td>Blue, M</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10002</td>
      <td>Sweetly T-shirt 1</td>
      <td>Blue, XL</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10003</td>

    <tr>

<p>
For the index building, prepare the family data in the database, separate a table for family info.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>SKU#</th>
      <th>FAMILY_ID</th>
      <th>ATTR_NAME</th>
      <th>ATTR_VALUE</th>
      <th>ATTR_TYPE</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>10001</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Color</td>
      <td>Blue</td>
      <td>Swatch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10001</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Size</td>
      <td>M</td>
      <td>Dropdown</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10008</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Color</td>
      <td>Red</td>
      <td>Swatch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10008</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Size</td>
      <td>XL</td>
      <td>Dropdown</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

(Above DB table is just a example, it depends on your product management system and may need optimize.)

Querying

<p>
Now let's use aggregation at search. <br>
Aggregation (called Faceting in some search engine) is similar to "Group By" in relational database.
Trigger the search with query term and point out the fields to aggregate, you can get all matched result with gather family results.
</p>

<p>
I'm not go through the detail of aggregation search API here, please refer to <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SimpleFacetParameters" target="_blank">SimpleFacetParameters</a> for Solr and <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html" target="_blank">Search Aggregations</a> for Elasticsearch.
